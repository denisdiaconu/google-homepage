In this project we are creating a Google.com homepage.
I started putting the main elements on the page with a navbar in the top and bottom.
Then i put the logo and the serch bar with the buttons.
While working with the style in css i tried my best in makeing it look like the original.
This was my frist project i had some problems but it helped me learn so many new ways of using css.
